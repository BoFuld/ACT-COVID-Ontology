## Existing codes

### CDC coding guidelines for coding with existing ICD-10 codes
* **Pneumonia confirmed as due to COVID-19:** J12.89 Other viral pneumonia & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Lower respiratory infection due to COVID-19:** J22 Unspecified acute lower respiratory infection & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Respiratory infection due to COVID-19:** J98.8 Other specified respiratory disorders & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Acute Bronchitis confirmed as due to COVID-19:** J20.8 Acute bronchitis due to other specified organisms & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Bronchitis not otherwise specified (NOS) due to the COVID-19:** J40 Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19:** J80, Acute respiratory distress syndrome & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **An actual exposure to someone who is confirmed to have COVID-19:** Z20.828 Contact with and (suspected) exposure to other viral communicable diseases & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Concern about a possible exposure to COVID-19, but this is ruled out after evaluation:** Z03.818 Encounter for observation for suspected exposure to other biological agents ruled out & B97.29 Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
* **Signs/symptoms (such as fever, etc.) but definitive diagnosis has not been established:** R05 Cough, R06.02 Shortness of breath, R50.9 Fever, unspecified
* Diagnosis code B34.2, Coronavirus infection, unspecified, would generally not be appropriate for COVID-19

## New codes

### ICD-10 for diagnosis recording
* An emergency ICD-10 code of U07.1 is assigned to the disease diagnosis of COVID-19
* See https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/covid19/en/

### HCPCS
* U0001 for CDC testing laboratories to test patients for SARS-CoV-2
* U0002 for non-CDC laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (COVID-19)
* Take effect by April 1, however retroactive claims will be accepted from February 4th forward.
* See https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-develops-additional-code-coronavirus-lab-tests
